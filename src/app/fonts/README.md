# Lovelo Font Files

To use the Lovelo font in this project, you need to add the following font files to this directory:

- `Lovelo-Black.woff2` (font-weight: 900)
- `Lovelo-Bold.woff2` (font-weight: 700)

## How to get the font files:

1. If you have a license for Lovelo font, download it from Fontfabric
2. Convert the font files to WOFF2 format using an online converter like:
   - https://convertio.co/otf-woff2/
   - https://cloudconvert.com/otf-to-woff2
3. Place the converted files in this directory

## Alternative approach:

If you don't have the font files, you can:
1. Use a similar free font like "Bebas Neue" or "Oswald"
2. Purchase a web license for Lovelo from Fontfabric
3. Use a font service like Google Fonts with a similar style

The font is already configured in the code and will fallback to sans-serif if the files are not present.
